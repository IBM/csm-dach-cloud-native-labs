# csm-dach-cloud-native-labs
Workshops to teach the basics of containerization and OpenShift.

_Based on: https://github.com/ibm-garage-dach/cloud-native-bootcamp-ocp311_

_Proposal_

Day 1:

 * LAB 0: connect to VM and make sure podman and oc are working
 * LAB 1: Managing Images and Containers with Podman (_podman.md_)
 * LAB 2: Create Custom Images (_containerfile.md_)
 * LAB 3: _is there enough time to add something else?__

Day 2:

 * LAB 4: working with OpenShift
- Use another application, not a ruby one.

 * LAB 5 and 6: which ones? Proposal: create app from image + create app from source
