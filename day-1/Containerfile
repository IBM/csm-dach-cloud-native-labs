RUN yum install -y httpd &&\

# The RUN command is executed during build
# Each RUN command adds a layer to the image, so it's a good practice to use && to combine commands

ENTRYPOINT ["httpd"]
# The ENTRYPOINT is the command to be executed on the container when it is started 
# The entrypoint can't be overriden

CMD ["-D", "FOREGROUND"]
# The CMD command provides the parameters for the command specified in ENTRYPOINT
# The arguments can be overriden by passing them at the end of _podman run_
